[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MSF-Jarvis/viscerion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MSF-Jarvis/viscerion)

Refreshed take at the official Android client with a nicer UI and additional features. Built with the best of [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/).

## Building

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/viscerion --recursive
$ cd viscerion
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Note: on macOS you also need to install the GNU `coreutils` package through homebrew.

# Disclaimer
As I've made abundantly clear on my Play Store listing, this is *not* an officially endorsed product. The WireGuard development team is not in any way affiliated with this project and I intend to keep it that way. Please do not approach them for any issues encountered during the usage of Viscerion, those belong to me unless it's an issue with an upstream component.
